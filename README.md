# Duplicated genes in Theobroma cacao genome
*Master genomics projet, Paris Saclay University*

**Aim of the project** : find duplicated sequences across a plant genome. Case study : *Theobroma Cacao*, the cacao tree. For the comparison of nucleic acid sequences would be  time- and ressources-consumming, one should better stick with the information conveyed in the amino acid sequences. Also because some mutation do not really change the local properties of the protein.


### Isoform selection

Each gene display several transcripts. Because two transcripts of the same gene are really likely to be detected as a gene duplication, some isoform filtering has to be done. 
Here, we chose to keep the longest isoform, assuming that it countains the most information about the gene

### BLASTp run

BLASTp is run in order to align every selected peptide with every other. 

### Clustering of BLAST results

Then, the FTAG Finder v3 pipeline on the Galaxy platform is used to cluster sequences into families based on the BLAST results
