# Duplicated genes and genes family in *Theobroma cacao* genome
## Case study of the Cysteine-rich kinases superfamily

## Abstract
*Theobroma cacao* or cacao is an angiosperm plant species intensely cultivated across the world. In this work we have investigated the genomic landscape of the cacao in order to both detect gene specific and whole genome duplication events. Our results were shared with our classmates in order to compare the evolution rates of different plants genomes.

## Main results
### Gene families sizes repartition in *Theobroma cacao*
The FTAG finder tool was used in order to reconstruct genes families within our set of selected isoforms. Figure 1 display the occurrence of families according to their sizes. We can observe that, most of families count a small number of proteins (bellow five). However some families of impressive sizes are also displayed (up to 425 members for the biggest family). Those results were shared with our classmates in order to compare the gene families sizes between differents specie.
