# Duplicated genes in Theobroma cacao genome
*Master genomics projet, Paris Saclay University*

**Aim of the project** : find duplicated sequences across a plant genome. Case study : *Theobroma Cacao*, the cacao tree. For the comparison of nucleic acid sequences would be  time- and ressources-consumming, one should better stick with the information conveyed in the amino acid sequences. Also because some mutation do not really change the local properties of the protein.
